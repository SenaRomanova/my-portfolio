            Implemented malloc, calloc, realloc, and free using explicit free lists to reuse blocks and reduce OS calls.
            Challenges included managing pointer arithmetic safely, maintaining 8-byte alignment across allocations, 
            and ensuring realloc worked correctly without introducing memory errors. 
            The allocator was tested by running standard Unix commands successfully on top of it."

              Used scikit-learn to add metrics and evaluate the accuracy of my trained model.
